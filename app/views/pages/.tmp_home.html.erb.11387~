                For four years, I have served as a Sr. Subject Matter Expert for Amdocs Dev. Ltd., where I have been repeatedly recognized for developing innovative solutions. Working in Agile (Scrum) development methodology I was responsible for development of next-generation software, from design, coding to testing, documentation and implementation. I have also served the role of a "scrum master".Known for excellent client-facing skills, I also excel in merging business and user needs into high-quality, cost-effective design solutions while keeping within budgetary constraints.
